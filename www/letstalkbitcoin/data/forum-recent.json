Litecoin managed to get out of its downtrend after being helped by the BTC recovery.\r\n\r\nNew Highs for Bitcoin\r\n\r\nNew highs were reached today at $2791 dollars per coin. This is a gain of $571 or over 25 percent since our last update. It seems that BTC gains are getting close parabolic again, which means either even bigger gains or another sharp correction. As a reminder, the last one took down BTC\/USD by $1,026 from the highs.\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/imgur.com\/YuFL0hV\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YuFL0hV.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" \/><\/a>\r\nRead more: https:\/\/blog.fxopen.com\/new-highs-for-bitcoin\/","boardId":"59","boardName":"Market Speculation","boardSlug":"market-speculation","categoryId":"8","categoryName":"Content Garden","categorySlug":"content","locked":"0","postTime":"2017-06-06 06:40:05","editTime":"2017-06-06 06:40:29","lastPost":"2017-06-06 06:40:05","sticky":"0","views":"54","lockTime":null,"lockedBy":"0","editedBy":"3401","count":null,"replies":null,"author":{"userId":"3401","username":"andref","slug":"andref","regDate":"2014-08-29 07:11:34","lastActive":"2017-07-05 07:02:12","profile":{"ltbcoin-address":{"fieldId":"12","value":"1JMjGhUd16wuYXEzPZz1V2u37wHuc5xYJp","label":"LTBcoin <a href='https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ltb-companion-wallet\/jmjmgcgkbndiepapjbcabhdbbhmmkhmj' target='_blank'>Compatible Address<\/a>","type":"textbox","slug":"ltbcoin-address"},"location":{"fieldId":"7","value":"in sistem","label":"Location","type":"textbox","slug":"location"},"forum-signature":{"fieldId":"11","value":"account BTC https:\/\/www.fxopen.com\/en?agent=495446","label":"Forum Signature","type":"textarea","slug":"forum-signature"}},"avatar":"https:\/\/letstalkbitcoin.com\/files\/avatars\/0197027406a2eba3c1e28581cb845a2d.jpg","custom_status":false,"real_avatar":"0197027406a2eba3c1e28581cb845a2d.jpg"},"mostRecent":false},"11":{"topicId":"16291","userId":"38","title":"No LTB Episode  (Delayed a week)","url":"another-sunday-ltb-episode-delayed-a-day","content":"Update:\r\n\r\nOk!

After some consolidation around the area prices surged higher to top out at $2,226 on Fxopen. The primary driver behind this surge was speculation about a scaling agreement at the Consensus 2017 conference.\r\n\r\nThe rumored deal was set to be published on Monday morning US time. When this didn\u2019t transpire, prices crashed, testing $2,000 on most exchanges (see chart below). On FxOpen we traded as low as $2020 before a recovery rally began. The reversal was helped by the official agreement announcement on Tuesday that sent prices back near all-time highs.\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/imgur.com\/6bkeLB4\"><img src=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6bkeLB4.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" \/><\/a>\r\nRead more: https:\/\/blog.fxopen.com\/bitcoin-breaks-2000-on-scaling-agreement\/","boardId":"59","boardName":"Market Speculation","boardSlug":"market-speculation","categoryId":"8","categoryName":"Content Garden","categorySlug":"content","locked":"0","postTime":"2017-05-23 22:53:32","editTime":"2017-05-23 22:54:07","lastPost":"2017-05-23 22:53:32","sticky":"0","views":"100","lockTime":null,"lockedBy":"0","editedBy":"3401","count":null,"replies":null,"author":{"userId":"3401","username":"andref","slug":"andref","regDate":"2014-08-29 07:11:34","lastActive":"2017-07-05 07:02:12","profile":{"ltbcoin-address":{"fieldId":"12","value":"1JMjGhUd16wuYXEzPZz1V2u37wHuc5xYJp","label":"LTBcoin <a href='https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ltb-companion-wallet\/jmjmgcgkbndiepapjbcabhdbbhmmkhmj' target='_blank'>Compatible Address<\/a>","type":"textbox","slug":"ltbcoin-address"},"location":{"fieldId":"7","value":"in sistem","label":"Location","type":"textbox","slug":"location"},"forum-signature":{"fieldId":"11","value":"account BTC https:\/\/www.fxopen.com\/en?agent=495446","label":"Forum Signature","type":"textarea","slug":"forum-signature"}},"avatar":"https:\/\/letstalkbitcoin.com\/files\/avatars\/0197027406a2eba3c1e28581cb845a2d.jpg","custom_status":false,"real_avatar":"0197027406a2eba3c1e28581cb845a2d.jpg"},"mostRecent":false},"16":{"topicId":"16681","userId":"3401","title":"Cryptocurrency Analytics from FXOpen.18\/05\/2017","url":"cryptocurrency-analytics-from-fxopen18-05-2017","content":"It\u2019s been a volatile two weeks since our last update.
